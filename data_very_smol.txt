my 
girlfriend 
and 
I met 
in high school, 
and in high school, 
I was friends with 
her friends including Jacob. 
I remember when I was friends with Jacob 
how he told me he found my girlfriend hot 
and how he liked her legs. And I remember 
when my girlfriend told me (before we were dating) 
that she would make up with Jacob. 
Fast forward 3 years, and they are both in college, 
with another girl and a guy, in the same major and 
with the same classes every day. 
If my girlfriend doesn't have a ride Jacbo drives her, and he has to drive 40 minutes extra to get her home.
